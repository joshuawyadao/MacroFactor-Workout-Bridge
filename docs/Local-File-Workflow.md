# Local File Workflow

The project keeps personal workout files in `local-data/`, which is entirely excluded from Git. This provides a predictable place to drop new inputs and a local validation/version history without putting private workout data in repository history.

## Directory structure

```text
local-data/
├── inbox/
│   ├── coach/              # Drop new coach .xlsx workbooks here
│   └── macrofactor/        # Drop new exercise-log .csv or .xlsx exports here
├── archive/
│   ├── coach/              # Validated, consistently named workbook copies
│   └── macrofactor/        # Validated, date-range-named exercise-log copies
├── current/                # Stable shortcuts to the inputs the app should use
├── generated/
│   ├── workbooks/          # Save completed coach workbook copies here
│   └── reports/            # Save preview/apply JSON reports here
└── manifests/              # One validation manifest per archive run
```

Create or repair this structure at any time:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m macrofactor_bridge.local_workspace setup
```

After an editable install, the shorter equivalent is:

```bash
macrofactor-workspace setup
```

## Recurring workflow

1. Save the latest coach `.xlsx` file into `local-data/inbox/coach/`. Keep whatever filename the download already has.
2. Export the MacroFactor exercise log and save its `.csv` or `.xlsx` file into `local-data/inbox/macrofactor/`. There is no need to rename it.
3. Validate and archive everything currently in both inboxes:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m macrofactor_bridge.local_workspace archive \
     --config config/exercises.local.json
   ```

4. Display the newest validated paths:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m macrofactor_bridge.local_workspace status
   ```

5. Open MacroFactor Workout Bridge and select `current/Coach Program - Current.xlsx` plus `current/MacroFactor Exercise Log - Current.csv` or `.xlsx`. These stable shortcuts are updated by the archive command. Preview the selected worksheet, week, and explicit workout dates.
6. Save the generated workbook under `local-data/generated/workbooks/` and its JSON report under `local-data/generated/reports/`.

When an `.xlsx` export contains MacroFactor's `Active Program` table, the preview reports non-empty exercise-level notes for exercises performed in the selected dates. This can carry context such as equipment choice or a misload explanation when entered in the exercise note. The current export's `Workout Log` table does not include program-level or session-level note columns, so those note types cannot be recovered. Reported notes remain review-only and are never inserted into coach result cells automatically.

The archive command copies files; it never moves, changes, or deletes inbox files. An invalid file remains in the inbox, is recorded as an error in the run manifest, and is not copied into the archive.

An exercise-log export must contain at least one usable completed set: a non-empty exercise and set type, with a positive finite rep count. Mixed exports can still be archived when some rows are incomplete; preview continues to report and skip those rows. Archival validation does not guarantee a matching, writable coach result cell.

## Version and validation history

The archive command derives names from validated content rather than the uploaded filename. Every name begins with the UTC upload/intake date so versions are easy to search by when they were added. MacroFactor exports also include the first and last workout dates present in the export. Both file types end with the first twelve characters of the SHA-256 content hash:

```text
2026-08-24--Coach-Program--59f565015e32.xlsx
2026-08-25--2026-08-18_to_2026-08-24--MacroFactor-Exercise-Log--a57f84bd0ed1.xlsx
```

Searching an archive folder for `2026-08-25` finds everything uploaded on that date. Different file contents create distinct versions even when Downloads adds names such as ` (2)` or the same downloaded filename is reused. Dropping identical content again reuses its first upload-dated canonical archive copy but still creates a new manifest recording the later validation run. The exact original upload name and every intake timestamp are retained in manifests for traceability.

The `current/` entries are relative symbolic links, so they do not duplicate the workbook data. The tool updates only links it manages and refuses to overwrite a regular file at one of those names. For MacroFactor, the current link chooses the export with the latest workout date; when two exports end on the same date, it prefers the one with the later starting date. The current coach link chooses the most recently modified validated workbook.

History selection skips malformed manifest entries, invalid workout ranges, missing or invalid timezone-aware modification timestamps, and archive copies whose hashes no longer match. One damaged entry does not prevent the remaining valid history from being used.

Each manifest records:

- the full SHA-256 hash and byte size;
- the original filename, modification time, inbox path, and archive path;
- whether an existing identical archive copy was reused;
- the canonical files selected by the stable current shortcuts;
- coach worksheet, exercise-header, and week discovery;
- MacroFactor row count, workout date range, and exercise count;
- validation errors for anything not archived.

This is local version history, not a backup service. Back up `local-data/` separately if protection against disk loss is important.

## Privacy and safety

- The whole `local-data/` tree is ignored by Git.
- Personal exports, manifests, generated workbooks, and reports must not be force-added to Git.
- Only MacroFactor exercise-log exports belong in the MacroFactor inbox. Program exports do not contain the required exercise-log table and will fail validation.
- Keep using Preview before creating output. Archival validation does not authorize or perform workbook writes.
- The coach workbook and MacroFactor export selected by the app remain unchanged; output always uses a separate filename.
